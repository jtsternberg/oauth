## Description

The OAuth protocol enables websites or applications (Consumers) to access Protected Resources from a web service (Service Provider) via an API, without requiring Users to disclose their Service Provider credentials to the Consumers. An example use case is allowing printing service printer-example.com (the Consumer), to access private photos stored on photos-example.com (the Service Provider) without requiring Users to provide their photos-example.com credentials to printer-example.com.

More generally, OAuth creates a freely-implementable and generic methodology for API authentication, benefitting developers who want their Consumer product to interact with various Service Providers.

OAuth does not require a specific user interface or interaction pattern, nor does it specify how Service Providers authenticate Users, making the protocol ideally suited for cases where authentication credentials are unavailable to the Consumer, such as with OpenID. 

OAuth aims to unify the experience and implementation of delegated web service authentication into a single, community-driven protocol. OAuth builds on existing protocols and best practices that have been independently implemented by various websites. An open standard, supported by large and small providers alike, promotes a consistent and trusted experience for both application developers and the users of those applications.

## Notation and Conventions 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

## Definitions

* OAuth Protocol Parameters
: Parameters with names beginning with `oauth_`.

## Documentation and Registration

OAuth includes a Consumer Key and matching Consumer Secret that together authenticate the Consumer (as opposed to the User) to the Service Provider. Consumer-specific identification allows the Service Provider to vary access levels to Consumers (such as un-throttled API access or other resources). 

Service Providers SHOULD NOT rely on the Consumer Secret as a method to verify the Consumer identity, unless the Consumer Secret is known to be inaccessible to anyone other than the Consumer and the Service Provider. Consumer Secrets MAY be an empty string when no Consumer verification is needed.

### Endpoint URLs

All Endpoint URLs for both Service Providers and Consumers MUST include scheme, authority, and path, and MAY include query and fragment as defined by [RFC 3986] section 3. The Endpoint URL query MUST NOT contain any OAuth Protocol Parameters. For example:

    http://example.com/authorize

### Service Providers

Service Providers responsibility is to enable Consumer Developers to establish a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. The process and requirements for provisioning these are entirely up to the Service Providers.

The Service Providers documentation includes:

1. The OAuth Endpoint URLs that the Consumer will use when making OAuth requests.
2. Signature methods supported by the Service Provider.
3. Any additional request parameters that the Service Provider requires in order to obtain a Token. Service Provider specific parameters MUST NOT begin with `oauth_`.

### Consumers

The Consumer Developer MUST establish a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret with the Service Provider. The Consumer Developer MAY also be required to provide additional information to the Service Provider upon registration.

## Parameters

OAuth Protocol Parameter names and values are case sensitive. Each OAuth Protocol Parameters MUST NOT appear more than once per request, and are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted.

### Parameter Encoding

All parameter names and values are escaped using the [RFC 3986] percent-encoding (%xx) mechanism. Characters not in the unreserved character set ([RFC 3986] section 2.3) MUST be encoded. Characters in the unreserved character set MUST NOT be encoded. Hexadecimal characters in encodings MUST be upper case. Text names and values MUST be encoded as UTF-8 octets before percent-encoding them per [RFC 3629].

    unreserved = ALPHA, DIGIT, "-", ".", "_", "~"

### Sending Request Parameters

OAuth Protocol Parameters are sent from the Consumer to the Service Provider in one of three methods, in order of decreasing preference:

1. In the HTTP `Authorization` header as defined in "OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme".
2. Added to the HTTP Request Body.
3. Added to the URLs in the query part (as defined by [RFC 3986] section 3).

In addition to these defined methods, future extensions may describe alternate methods for sending the OAuth Protocol Parameters.

### OAuth Endpoint URLs Response Parameters

OAuth Endpoint URLs response parameters are sent by the Service Provider to return Tokens and other information to the Consumer in the HTTP response body. The parameter names and values are first encoded as per the "Encoding Parameters" section, and concatenated with the `&` character (ASCII code 38) as defined in [RFC 3986] Section 2.1. For example:

    oauth_token=ab3cd9j4ks73hf7g&oauth_token_secret=xyz4992k83j47x0b

### OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme

This section defines an [RFC 2617] extension to support OAuth. It uses the standard HTTP `Authorization` and `WWW-Authenticate` headers to pass OAuth Protocol Parameters. 

It is RECOMMENDED that Service Providers accept the HTTP `Authorization` header. Consumers SHOULD be able to supply an OAuth `Authorization` header as an alternative to passing OAuth Protocol Parameters.

The extension auth-scheme (as defined by [RFC 2617]) is `OAuth` and is case-insensitive.

#### Authorization Header

The OAuth Protocol Parameters are sent in the `Authorization` header the following way:

1. Parameter names and values are encoded per "Encoding Parameters".
2. For each parameter, the name is immediately followed by an `=` character (ASCII code 61), a `"` character (ASCII code 34), the parameter value (MAY be empty), and another `"` character (ASCII code 34).
3. Parameters are separated by a comma character (ASCII code 44) followed by a space (ASCII code 32).

For example:

    Authorization: OAuth oauth_token="ad180jjd733klru7", oauth_consumer_key="0685bd9184jfhq22", oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1", oauth_signature="c0e2483bd0365b9985c038220ef65b4d230afcf6"

#### WWW-Authenticate Header

Service Providers MAY indicate their support for the extension by returning the OAuth HTTP `WWW-Authenticate` header upon API Endpoint URL requests for Protected Resources. As per [RFC 2617] such a response MAY include additional HTTP `WWW-Authenticate` headers:

For example:

    WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize"

The realm parameter defines a protection realm per [RFC 2617], section 1.2. The parameter MAY specify the Authorization Endpoint URL to be used by the Consumer to obtain authorization for the accessed resource.

## Authenticating with OAuth

OAuth authentication is the process in which Users grant access to their Protected Resources without sharing their credentials with the Consumer. OAuth uses Tokens generated by the Service Provider instead of the User's credentials in Protected Resources requests. The process uses two Token types:

* Request Token
: Used by the Consumer to ask the User to authorize access to the Protected Resources. The authorized Request Token is exchanged for an Access Token, MUST only be used once, and MUST NOT be used for any other purpose. It is RECOMMENDED that Request Tokens have a limited lifetime.
* Access Token
: Used by the Consumer to access the Protected Resources on behalf of the User. Access Tokens MAY limit access to certain Protected Resources, and MAY have a limited lifetime. Service Providers SHOULD allow Users to revoke Access Tokens. Only the Access Token SHALL be used to access the Protect Resources.

OAuth Authentication is done in three steps:

1. The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token.
2. The User authorizes the Request Token.
3. The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token.

### Obtaining an Unauthorized Request Token

The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token by asking the Service Provider to issue a Token. The Request Token's sole purpose is to receive User approval and can only be used to obtain an Access Token. The Request Token process goes as follows:

1. The Consumer requests a Request Token.
2. The Service Provider issues an unauthorized Request Token.

#### 1. Consumer Obtains a Request Token

To obtain a Request Token, the Consumer sends an HTTP GET request to the Service Provider's OAuth Endpoint URL for Request Token requests. The request MUST be signed and contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
: The Consumer Key.
* `oauth_callback`
: OPTIONAL. The Consumer MAY specify a URL the Service Provider will use to redirect the User back to the Consumer when "Obtaining User Authorization" is complete.
* `oauth_version`
: OPTIONAL. If present, value MUST be `1.0`. Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be `1.0` if this parameter is not present. Service Providers’ response to non-`1.0` value is left undefined.
* REQUIRED signature parameters per "Signing API Requests".
* Any additional parameters, as defined by the Service Provider.

#### 2. Service Provider Issues an Unauthorized Request Token

The Service Provider verifies the signature and Consumer Key and if successful, generates a Request Token and Token Secret and returns them to the Consumer in the HTTP response body as defined in "OAuth Endpoint URLs Response Parameters". The Service Provider MUST ensure the Request Token cannot be exchanged for an Access Token until the User successfully grants access in step 4 below.

The response contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_token`
: The Request Token.
* `oauth_token_secret`
: The Token Secret.
* Any additional parameters, as defined by the Service Provider.

If the request fails verification or is rejected for other reasons, the Service Provider MUST respond with the appropriate response code as defined in "HTTP Response Codes". The Service Provider MAY include some further details about why the request was rejected in the HTTP response body as defined in "OAuth Endpoint URLs Response Parameters".

### Obtaining User Authorization

The Consumer cannot use the Request Token until it has been authorized by the User. Obtaining User authorization includes the following steps:

1. The Consumer directs the User to the Service Provider.
2. The Service Provider authenticates the User and obtains consent.
3. The Service Provider directs the User back to the Consumer.

#### 1. Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider

In order for the Consumer to be able to exchange the Request Token for an Access Token, the Consumer MUST obtain approval from the User by directing the User to the Service Provider. The Consumer constructs an HTTP GET request to the Service Provider's Authorization Endpoint URL with the following parameter:

* `oauth_token`
: OPTIONAL. The Request Token obtained in the previous step. The Service Provider MAY declare this parameter as REQUIRED, or accept requests to the Authorization Endpoint URL without it, in which case it will prompt the User to enter it manually.

Once the request URL has been constructed the Consumer redirects the User to the URL via the User's web browser. If the Consumer is incapable of automatic HTTP redirection, the Consumer SHALL notify the User how to manually go to the constructed request URL.

Note: If a Service Provider knows a Consumer to be running on a mobile device or set-top box, the Service Provider SHOULD ensure that the Authorization Endpoint URL and Request Token are suitable for manual entry. 

#### 2. Service Provider Authenticates the User and Obtains Consent

The Service Provider verifies the User's identity and asks for consent as detailed. OAuth does not specify how the Service Provider authenticates the User. However, it does define a set of REQUIRED steps:

* The Service Provider MUST first verify the User's identity before asking for consent. It MAY prompt the User to sign in if the User has not already done so.
* The Service Provider presents to the User information about the Consumer requesting access (as registered by the Consumer Developer). The information MUST include the duration of the access and the Protected Resources provided. The information MAY include other details specific to the Service Provider.
* The User MUST grant or deny permission for the Service Provider to give the Consumer access to the Protected Resources on behalf of the User. If the User denies the Consumer access, the Service Provider MUST NOT allow access to the Protected Resources.

When displaying any identifying information about the Consumer to the User based on the Consumer Key, the Service Provider MUST inform the User if it is unable to assure the Consumer’s true identity. The method in which the Service Provider informs the User and the quality of the identity assurance is beyond the scope of this specification.

For example, the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret of a desktop application running on a User desktop can be extracted and abused, while a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret stored on a web server behind a firewall is more protected.

#### 3. Service Provider Directs the User Back to the Consumer

After the User authenticates with the Service Provider and grants permission for Consumer access, the Consumer MUST be notified that the Request Token has been authorized and ready to be exchanged for an Access Token. If the User denies access, the Consumer MAY be notified that the Request Token has been revoked.

If the Consumer provided a callback URL in `oauth_callback` (as described in "Consumer Obtains a Request Token"), the Service Provider constructs an HTTP GET request URL, and redirects the User's web browser to that URL with the following parameters:

* `oauth_token`
: The Request Token the User authorized or denied.

The callback URL MAY include Consumer provided query parameters. The Service Provider MUST retain them unmodified and append the `oauth_token` parameter to the existing query.

If no callback URL was provided, the Service Provider instructs the User to manually inform the Consumer that authorization has completed.

### Obtaining an Access Token

The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token capable of accessing the Protected Resources. Obtaining an Access Token includes the following steps:

1. The Consumer Requests an Access Token.
2. The Service Provider Grants an Access Token.

#### 1. Consumer Requests an Access Token

The Request Token and Token Secret MUST be exchanged for an Access Token and Token Secret.

To request an Access Token, the Consumer makes an HTTP request to Service Provider OAuth Endpoint URL for Token exchange. The Service Provider documentation MUST specify either HTTP GET or POST for this endpoint. It is RECOMMENDED that this be a POST request. The request MUST be signed per "Signing API Requests", and contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
: The Consumer Key.
* `oauth_token`
: The Request Token obtained previously.
* REQUIRED signature parameters per "Signing API Requests".

No additional Service Provider specific parameters are allowed when requesting an Access Token to ensure all Token related information is present prior to seeking User approval.

#### 2. Service Provider Grants an Access Token

The Service Provider exchanges the Consumer's Authorization for a new Access Token and Token Secret. The Service Provider MUST verify that:

* The request is properly signed.
* The Request Token has not been exchanged before for an Access Token.
* The Request Token matches the Consumer Key.

On successful verification, the Service Provider returns an Access Token and a Token Secret in the HTTP response body as defined in "OAuth Endpoint URLs Response Parameters". The Access Token and Token Secret are stored by the Consumer and used when signing Protected Resources requests. The response contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_token`
: The Access Token.
* `oauth_token_secret`
: The Token Secret.
* Any additional parameters, as defined by the Service Provider.

If the request fails verification or is rejected for other reasons, the Service Provider MUST respond with the appropriate response code as defined in "HTTP Response Codes". The Service Provider MAY include some further details about why the request was rejected in the HTTP response body as defined in "OAuth Endpoint URLs Response Parameters".

## Accessing Protected Resources

After successfully receiving the Access Token and Token Secret, the Consumer is able to access the Protected Resources on behalf of the User. The request MUST be signed per "Signing API Requests", and contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
: The Consumer Key.
* `oauth_token`
: The Access Token.
* REQUIRED signature parameters per "Signing API Requests".
* Any additional parameters, as defined by the Service Provider.

## Signing API Requests

The purpose of signing API requests is to prevent unauthorized parties from using the Consumer Key and Tokens when making OAuth Endpoint URL requests or API Endpoint URL requests. The signature process encodes the Consumer Secret and Token Secret into a verifiable value which is included with the request.

OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method, as each API implementation can have its own unique requirements. The protocol defines two signature methods: `HMAC-SHA1`, `PLAINTEXT`, but Service Providers are free to implement and document their own methods. Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification.

All OAuth Endpoint URL requests and API Endpoint URL requests MUST be signed by the Consumer and verified by the Service Provider. Both the Consumer and Service Provider follow the same process to generate the request signature.

The Consumer declares a signature method in the `oauth_signature_method` parameter, and generates a signature. The Service Provider verifies the request by generating a new request signature based on the Consumer specified method, and compares it to the signature provided by the Consumer.

The signature process MUST NOT change the request parameter names or values. It is a read-only process on the request. All request parameters MUST be encoded as described in "Parameter Encoding" prior to applying the signature process.

### Signature Base String

1. Normalize Service Provider request parameters
2. Generate a Nonce
3. Concatenate parameters into a string

#### 1. Normalize Service Provider Request Parameters

All non-OAuth Protocol Parameters SHALL be normalized before used for signing. If a request Endpoint contains a query, it is broken into individual parameters which are treated like any other non-OAuth Protocol Parameter. The parameters are normalized into a single string as follows:

1. Parameters are sorted by name, using lexicographical byte value ordering. If two or more parameters share the same name, they are sorted by their value. For example: `a=1`, `c=hi%20there`, `f=25`, `f=50`, `z=10`.
2. Parameters are concatenated in their sorted order into a single string. For each parameter, the name is separated from the corresponding value by an `=` character (ASCII code 61), even if the value is empty. Each name-value pair is separated by an `&` character (ASCII code 38). For example: `a=1&c=hi%20there&f=25&f=50&z=10`.
3. The concatenated string is encoded as described in "Parameter Encoding".

#### 2. Generate a Nonce and Timestamp

A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated for each request. The nonce allows the Service Provider to verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when requests are made over a non-secure channel (such as HTTP).

The Consumer SHALL first calculate the request timestamp expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. The timestamp value MUST be equal or greater than the timestamp used in previous requests. The Consumer SHALL then generate a Nonce value that is unique for all requests with that timestamp.

When verifying a Consumer signature, the Service Provider SHOULD check the request nonce to ensure it has not been used in a previous Consumer request. Since the nonce is unique per timestamp, and timestamps are always equal or greater, the Service Provider only needs to keep track of nonces with the most up-to-date timestamps. Service Providers May also skip checking the nonce in Consumer requests for Access Token, as the Request Token can only be used once already.

#### 3. Concatenate Parameters into a String

The OAuth Protocol Parameters and values generated in the previous two steps are concatenated into a single string used as the input to the signature algorithm. The request parameters MUST be concatenated in the following order:

1. The value of `oauth_consumer_key`.
2. The Consumer Secret.
3. The value of `oauth_token`.
4. The value of `oauth_token_secret`.
5. The HTTP request method used to send the request. Value MUST be uppercase, for example: `HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, etc.
6. The URL as defined in "Endpoint URLs" excluding the query and fragment parts.
7. The normalized Service Provider request parameters result string from step 1.
8. The timestamp value from step 2.
9. The nonce value from step 2.

The above request parameters and generated values are concatenated in order into a single string. Each signature item is separated by an `&` character (ASCII code 38), even if empty.

### HMAC-SHA1

* `oauth_signature_method`
: The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request.
* `oauth_signature`
: The signature as defined in "Signing API Requests".
* `oauth_ts`
: The numeric timestamp (unix epoch) unless defined otherwise by the Service Provider, e.g. monotonically increasing integer.
* `oauth_nonce`
: A nonce is a nonce is a nonce (but never three times like that) unless you're in the UK. FIXME


The `HMAC-SHA1` method includes the following steps:

1. Generate the Signature Base String
2. Calculate HMAC value
3. Set Signature parameters

#### 1. Generate the Signature Base String


#### 2. Calculate HMAC value 

The HMAC-SHA1 value of the concatenated string from step 3 (`concatenated_string`) is calculated using the Consumer Secret (`oauth_consumer_secret`, not encoded) as defined in [RFC 2104]:

    hmac_sha1(oauth_consumer_secret, concatenated_string)

The calculated value is used in HEX string format.

#### 3. Set Signature Parameters

The signature OAuth Protocol Parameters are set with the following values:

* `oauth_signature_method`
: Set to `HMAC-SHA1`.
* `oauth_signature`
: Set to the concatenated encoded values of the timestamp from step 2, the nonce from step 2, and the calculated HMAC from step 4. Each value is separated by an `.` character (ASCII code 46). If the values contain a `.` character (ASCII code 46), it must be encoded as `%2E`. The result MUST not be encoded again.

### PLAINTEXT

The `PLAINTEXT` method does not provide any security protection and SHOULD be used over a secure channel such as HTTPS. It does not use the Signature Base String. The signature OAuth Protocol Parameters are set with the following values unencrypted:

* `oauth_signature_method`
: Set to `PLAINTEXT`.
* `oauth_signature`
: Set to the concatenated encoded value of the Consumer Secret and the value of the `oauth_token_secret` parameter. If the values contain a `.` character (ASCII code 46), it must be encoded as `%2E`. The values are separated by a `.` character (ASCII code 46), even if empty. The result MUST not be encoded again.

For example, if the Consumer Secret is `dj.9rj$0jd78jf88` and Token Secret is `jjd999(j88ui.hs3`, the encoded values are:

* Consumer Secret
: `dj%2E9rj%240jd78jf88`
* `oauth_token_secret`
: `jjd999%28j88ui%2Ehs3`

And the `oauth_signature` value is `dj%2E9rj%240jd78jf88.jjd999%28j88ui%2Ehs3`. This value is not encoded anymore and is used as it in the HTTP request. If the Token Secret is empty, the value is `dj%2E9rj%240jd78jf88.` (the separator `.` is retained).

## HTTP Response Codes

This section applies only to the Request Token and Access Token OAuth Endpoint URL requests. In general, the Service Provider SHOULD use the response codes defined in [RFC 2616] Section 10. When the Service Provider rejects a Consumer request, it SHOULD respond with HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

* HTTP 400 Bad Request
  * Unsupported parameter
  * Unsupported signature method
  * Missing required parameter
  * Duplicated OAuth Protocol Parameter

* HTTP 401 Unauthorized
  * Invalid Consumer Key
  * Invalid / expired Token
  * Invalid signature
  * Invalid / used nonce

## Appendix A – Protocol Example

In this example, the Service Provider photos-example.com is a photo sharing website, and the Consumer printer-example.com is a photo printing website. Jane, the User, would like printer-example.com to print the private photo `vacation.jpg` stored at photos-example.com.

When Jane signs-into photos-example.com using her username and password, she can access the photo by going to the URL `http://photos-example.com/photo?file=vacation.jpg`. Other Users cannot access that photo, and Jane does not want to share her username and password with printer-example.com.

### 1. Documentation and Registration

The Service Provider documentation explains how to register for a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, and declares the following Endpoint URLs:

* Authorization Endpoint URL
: http://photos-example.com/authorize
* Request Token OAuth Endpoint URL
: https://photos-example.com/request_token
* Access Token OAuth Endpoint URL
: https://photos-example.com/access_token
* Photo (Protected Resource) API Endpoint URL
: http://photos-example.com/photo with required parameter `file` and optional parameter `size`

The Service Provider declares support for the `HMAC-SHA1` signature method for all requests, and `PLAINTEXT` only for secure (HTTPS) requests.

The Consumer printer-example.com already established a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret (as a web-based Consumer) with photos-example.com and advertizes its printing services for photos stored on photos-example.com. The Consumer registration is:

* Consumer Key
: `dpf43:3p2l4k3l03`
* Consumer Secret
: `kd94hf93k#23kf44`
* Callback Endpoint URL
: `http://printer-example.com/request_token_ready`

### 2. Obtaining a Request Token

After Jane informs printer-example.com that she would like to print her vacation photo at photos-example.com, the printer website tries to access the photo and receives HTTP 401 Unauthorized. The Consumer send the following HTTP GET request to the Service Provider:

    https://photos-example.com/request_token?oauth_consumer_key=dpf43 %3A3p2l4k3l03&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&oauth_signature=kd94hf93k%2323kf44.&oauth_version=1.0

The Service Provider checks the signature and replies with an unauthorized Request Token in the body of the HTTP response:

    oauth_token=hh%5Ds93j4hdidpola
    oauth_token_secret=hdhd0%2F44k9j7ao03

### 3. Requesting User Authorization

The Consumer redirects Jane’s browser to the Service Provider Authorization Endpoint URL to obtain Jane’s approval for accessing her private photos.

    http://photos-example.com/authorize?oauth_token=hh%5Ds93j4hdidpola

The Service Provider asks Jane to sign-in using her username and password and if successful, asks her if she approves granting printer-example.com access to her private photos. If Jane approves the request, the Service Provider redirects her back to the Consumer’s Callback Endpoint URL:

    http://printer-example.com/request_token_ready?oauth_token=hh%5Ds93j4hdidpola

### 4. Obtaining an Access Token

Now that the Consumer knows Jane approved the Request Token, it asks the Service Provider to exchange it for an Access Token:

    https://photos-example.com/access_token?oauth_consumer_key=dpf43 %3A3p2l4k3l03&oauth_token=hh%5Ds93j4hdidpola&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&oauth_signature=kd94hf93k%2323kf44.hdhd0%2F44k9j7ao03&oauth_version=1.0

The Service Provider checks the signature and replies with an Access Token in the body of the HTTP response:

    oauth_token=nnch73%40d00sl2jdk
    oauth_token_secret=%2B%24kkdhi9sl%28r.s00

### 5. Accessing Protected Resources

The Consumer is now ready to request the private photo. Since the photo API Endpoint URL is not secure (HTTP), it must use `HMAC-SHA1`. To generate the signature, the following inputs are used:

1. The value of `oauth_consumer_key`
: `dpf43:3p2l4k3l03`
2. The Consumer Secret
: `kd94hf93k#23kf44`
3. The value of `oauth_token`
: `nnch73@d00sl2jdk`
4. The value of `oauth_token_secret`
: `+$kkdhi9sl(r.s00`
5. The HTTP request
: `GET`
6. The API Endpoint
: `http://photos-example.com/photos`
7. The normalized Service Provider request parameters (already encoded)
: `file%3Dvacation.jpg%2Csize%3Doriginal`
8. The HTTP request body
: Empty
9. The timestamp (request is made on October 1st, 2007 at 12:34:56 AM GMT)
: `1191242096`
10. The nonce value
: `8392048:97482910`

The concatenated string is:

    dpf43%3A3p2l4k3l03&kd94hf93k%2323kf44& nnch73%40d00sl2jdk& %2B%24kkdhi9sl%28r.s00&GET&http%3A%2F%2Fphotos-example.com%2F&file%3Dvacation.jpg%2Csize%3Doriginal&&1191242096&8392048%3A97482910

Using HMAC-SHA1 with the concatenated string and Consumer Secret the hash value in HEX string is:

    3443483bd0365b9985c038220ef65b4d230afcf6

The `oauth_signature` is constructed from the timestamp, encoded nonce, and hash value, period-seperated:

    1191242096.8392048%3A97482910.3443483bd0365b9985c038220ef65b4d230afcf6

All together, the Consumer request for the photo is:

    http://photos-example.com/photos?file=vacation.jpg&size=original&oauth_consumer_key=dpf43%3A3p2l4k3l03&oauth_token=nnch73%40d00sl2jdk&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_signature=1191242096.8392048%3A97482910.3443483bd0365b9985c038220ef65b4d230afcf6

If the Service Provider supports the HTTP Authorization Headers extension, the Consumer can make the following request instead:

    http://photos-example.com/photos?file=vacation.jpg&size=original

    Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="dpf43%3A3p2l4k3l03",oauth_token="nnch73%40d00sl2jdk" oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",oauth_signature="1191242096.8392048%3A97482910.3443483bd0365b9985c038220ef65b4d230afcf6"

To which photos-example.com responds (after checking the signature) with the requested photo.
