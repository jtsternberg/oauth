        This document specifies the OAuth protocol authentication method. OAuth allows clients
        to access server resources on behalf of another party (such as a different client or an end
        user). This document defines an HTTP authentication method which supports the ability to
        include two sets of credential with each request, one identifying the client and another
        identifying the resource owner on whose behalf the request is made.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The OAuth protocol provides a method for servers to allow third-party access to protected
        resources, without forcing their end users to share their credentials. This pattern is
		    common among services that allow third-party developers to extend the service functionality,
		    by building applications using an open API.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        its private photos stored at a photo sharing service (server), without sharing its
        credentials with the printing service. Instead, the user authenticates directly with
        the photo sharing service and issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth introduces a third role to the traditional client-server authentication model: the
        resource owner. In the OAuth model, the client requests access to resources hosted by the
        server but not controlled by the client, but by the resource owner. In addition, OAuth
        allows the server to verify not only the resource owner's credentials, but also those of
        the client making the request.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for the client to access resources, it first has to obtain permission from the
        resource owner. This permission is expressed in the form of a token and matching
        shared-secret. The purpose of the token is to substitute the need for the resource owner to
        share its server credentials (usually a username and password pair) with the client. Unlike
        server credentials, tokens can be issued with a restricted scope and limited lifetime.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification consists of two parts. This document defines a method for making
        authenticated HTTP requests using two sets of credentials, one identifying the client
        making the request, and a second identifying the resource owner on whose behalf the
		    request is being made.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation" /> defines a redirection-based user agent
        process for end users to authorize client access to their resources, by authenticating
        directly with the server and provisioning tokens to the client for use with the
        authentication method.
      </t>

              by the client to establish its ownership of the token, and its authority to represent
              the resource owner.

      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Authenticated Requests">
      <t>
        The HTTP authentication methods defined by <xref target="RFC2617" />, enable clients
        to make authenticated HTTP requests. Clients using these methods gain access to protected
        resource by using their server credentials (typically a username and password pair), which
        allows the server to verify their authenticity. Using these methods for delegation requires
        the client to pretend it is the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method designed to include two sets of credentials with each request, one
        to identify the client, and another to identify the resource owner. Before a client can
        make authenticated requests on behalf of the resource owner, it must obtain a token
        authorized by the resource owner. <xref target="draft-ietf-oauth-web-delegation" /> provides one such
        method in which the client can obtain a token authorized by the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client credentials take the form of a unique identifier, and an associated share-secret
        or RSA key pair. Prior to making authenticated requests, the client establishes a set of
        credentials with the server. The process and requirements for provisioning these are
        outside the scope of this specification. Implementers are urged to consider the security
        ramification of using client credentials, some of which are described in
        <xref target="client_cred_sec" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        Making authenticated requests requires prior knowledge of the server's configuration.
        OAuth provides multiple methods for including protocol parameters in requests
        (<xref target="param_include" />), as well as multiple methods for the client to
        prove its rightful ownership of the credentials used (<xref target="signature" />).
        The way in which clients discover the required configuration is outside the scope of
        this specification.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Parameters">
      <t>
        An OAuth-authenticated request includes several protocol parameters. Each parameter name
        begins with the <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx> prefix, and the parameter names
        and values are case sensitive. Protocol parameters MUST NOT appear more than once per
        request. The parameters are:

        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
          <t hangText="oauth_consumer_key">
            <vspace />
            The identifier portion of the client credentials (equivalent to a username). The
            parameter name reflects a deprecated term (Consumer Key) used in previous revisions
            of the specification, and has been retained to maintain backward compatibility.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_token">
            <vspace />
            The token value used to associate the request with the resource owner. If the request
            is not associated with a resource owner (no token), clients MAY omit the parameter.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_signature_method">
            <vspace />
            The name of the signature method used by the client to sign the request,
		        as defined in <xref target="signature" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_signature">
            <vspace />
            The signature value as defined in <xref target="signature" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_timestamp">
            <vspace />
            The timestamp value as defined in <xref target="nonce" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_nonce">
            <vspace />
            The nonce value as defined in <xref target="nonce" />.
          </t>
          <t hangText="oauth_version">
            <vspace />
            The protocol version. If omitted, the protocol version defaults to
            <spanx style="verb">1.0</spanx>.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Server-specific request parameters MUST NOT begin with the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_</spanx> prefix.
      </t>
    </section>
      
    <section title="Nonce and Timestamp" anchor="nonce">
      <t>
        Unless otherwise specified by the server, the timestamp is expressed in the number of
        seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. The timestamp value MUST be a positive
        integer and MUST be equal or greater than the timestamp used in previous requests with
	  the same client credentials and token credentials combination.
      </t>
      <t>
        A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated to allows the server to verify that a
        request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when requests are
        made over a non-secure channel. The nonce value MUST be unique across all requests with
        the same timestamp, client credentials, and token combinations.
      </t>
      <t>
        To avoid the need to retain an infinite number of nonce values for future checks, servers
        MAY choose to restrict the time period after which a request with an old timestamp is
        rejected. Server applying such restriction SHOULD provide a way for the client to sync
        its clock with the server's clock.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Signature" anchor="signature">
      <t>
				OAuth-authenticated requests can have two sets of credentials: those passed via the
				<spanx style="verb">oauth_consumer_key</spanx> parameter and those in the
				<spanx style="verb">oauth_token</spanx> parameter. In order for the server to
				verify the authenticity of the request and prevent unauthorized access, the client needs
				to prove it is the rightful owner of the credentials. This is accomplished using the
				shared-secret (or RSA key) part of each set of credentials.
			</t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides three methods for the client to prove its rightful ownership of the
        credentials: <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>,
        and <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx>. These methods are generally referred to as
        signature methods, even though <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> does not involve a
        signature. In addition, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> utilizes an RSA key instead
        of the shared-secrets associated with the client credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method, as each implementation can have its
        own unique requirements. Servers are free to implement and document their own custom
        methods. Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client declares which signature method is used via the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature_method</spanx> parameter. It then generates a signature
        (or a sting of an equivalent value), and includes it in the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter. The server verifies the signature
        as specified for each method.
      </t>
      <t>
        The signature process does not change the request or its parameter, with the exception of
        the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter.
      </t>

      <section title="Signature Base String">
        <t>
          The signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several
          request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to the
          <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>
          signature methods, or potential future extension.
        </t>
        <t>
          The signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it
          does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP
          entity-headers. The importance of the signature base string scope is that the
          authenticity of the excluded components cannot be verified using the signature.
        </t>

        <section title="Collect Request Parameters" anchor="collect_param">
          <t>
            The signature base string includes a specific set of request parameters. In order for
            the parameter to be included in the signature base string, they MUST be used in their
            unencoded form.

            The request parameters, which include both protocol parameters and request-specific

          <t>
            In many cases, clients have direct access to the parameters in their original,
            unencoded form. In such cases, clients SHOULD use the unencoded values instead of
            extracting them. This option is not available for servers when validating incoming
            requests. Even though the parameters are encoded again in the process, they are
			      decoded because each of the three sources uses a different encoding algorithm.

        <section title="Construct Base String URI" anchor="sig_uri">
          <t>
            The signature base string incorporates the scheme, authority, and path of the request
            URI as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" /> section 3. The request URI query component
            is included through the <xref target="sig_norm_param">normalized parameters string</xref>,
            and the fragment component is excluded.
          </t>
          <t>
            This is done by constructing a base string URI representing the request without the query
            or fragment components. The base string URI is constructed as follows:

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>
                The scheme and host MUST be in lowercase.
              </t>
              <t>
                The host and port values MUST match the content of the HTTP request
                <spanx style="verb">Host</spanx> header, if present. If the
                <spanx style="verb">Host</spanx> header is not present, the client MUST use the
                hostname and port used to make the request. Servers SHOULD remove potential
                ambiguity in such cases by specifying the expected host value.
              </t>
              <t>
                The port MUST be included if it is not the default port for the scheme, and MUST
                be excluded if it is the default. Specifically, the port MUST be excluded when an
                <spanx style="verb">http</spanx> request uses port 80 or when an
                <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> request uses port 443. All other non-default
                port numbers MUST be included.
              </t>
              <t>
                If the URI includes an empty path, it MUST be included as <spanx style="verb">/</spanx>.

            Finally, the signature base string is put together by concatenating its elements

    <section title="Percent Encoding" anchor="encoding">
      <t>
        OAuth uses the following percent-encoding rules:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Text values are first encoded as UTF-8 octets per <xref target="RFC3629" /> if they are
            not already. This does not include binary values which are not intended for human
            consumption.
          </t>
          <t>
            The values are then escaped using the <xref target="RFC3986" /> percent-encoding
            (%XX) mechanism as follows:

            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
                Characters in the unreserved character set as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />
                section 2.3 (ALPHA, DIGIT, "-", ".", "_", "~") MUST NOT be encoded.

        This memo includes no request to IANA.

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        As stated in <xref target="RFC2617" />, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not
        in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use. Implementers
        are strongly encouraged to assess how this protocol addresses their security requirements.
      </t>

      <section title="RSA-SHA1 Signature Method">
        <t>
          When used with <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signatures, the
          OAuth protocol does not use the token shared-secret, or any provisioned client
          shared-secret. This means the protocol relies completely on the secrecy of the private
          key used by the client to sign requests.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="PLAINTEXT Signature Method">
        <t>
          When used with the <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> method, the protocol makes no
          attempts to protect credentials from eavesdroppers or man-in-the-middle attacks. The
          <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> method is only intended to be used in conjunction
          with a transport-layer security mechanism such as TLS or SSL which does provide such
          protection.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Confidentiality of Requests">
        <t>
          While OAuth provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it provides no
          guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are taken, eavesdroppers
          will have full access to request content. Servers should carefully consider the kinds of
          data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should employ transport-layer
          security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers">
        <t>
          OAuth makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the server. A hostile party could
          take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning misleading or
          otherwise incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when
          developing services based on OAuth, and should require transport-layer security for any
          requests where the authenticity of the server or of request responses is an issue.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proxying and Caching of Authenticated Content">
        <t>
          The <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization scheme</xref> is optional. However,
          <xref target="RFC2616" /> relies on the <spanx style="verb">Authorization</spanx> and
          <spanx style="verb">WWW-Authenticate</spanx> headers to distinguish authenticated content
          so that it can be protected. Proxies and caches, in particular, may fail to adequately
          protect requests not using these headers.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, private authenticated content may be stored in (and thus retrievable from)
          publicly-accessible caches. Servers not using the
          <xref target="auth_header">HTTP Authorization header</xref> should take care to use other
          mechanisms, such as the <spanx style="verb">Cache-Control</spanx> header, to ensure that
          authenticated content is protected.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plaintext Storage of Credentials">
        <t>
          The client shared-secret and token shared-secret function the same way passwords do in
          traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the signatures used in methods
          other than <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>, the server must have access to these
          secrets in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems,
          which store only a one-way hash of user credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to the server's database
          of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any
          resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these secrets from
          unauthorized access.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Secrecy of the Client Credentials" anchor="client_cred_sec">
        <t>
          In many cases, the client application will be under the control of potentially untrusted
          parties. For example, if the client is a freely available desktop application, an
          attacker may be able to download a copy for analysis. In such cases, attackers will be
          able to recover the client credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          Accordingly, servers should not use the client credentials alone to verify the identity
          of the client. Where possible, other factors such as IP address should be used as well.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cryptographic Attacks">
        <t>
          SHA-1, the hash algorithm used in <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> signatures, has
          been <xref target="SHA1-CHARACTERISTICS">shown</xref> to have a number of cryptographic
          weaknesses that significantly reduce its resistance to collision attacks. Practically
          speaking, these weaknesses are difficult to exploit, and by themselves do not pose a
          significant risk to users of OAuth. They may, however, make more efficient attacks
          possible, and NIST has <xref target="SHA-COMMENTS">announced</xref> that it will phase
          out use of SHA-1 by 2010. Servers should take this into account when considering whether
          SHA-1 provides an adequate level of security for their applications.
        </t>
      </section>

			<section title="Entropy of Secrets">
				<t>
					Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access
					to OAuth requests and signatures, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force
					attacks to recover the credentials used. Servers should be careful to assign
					shared-secrets which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at
					least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.
				</t>
				<t>
					For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is
					not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the shared-secret in less than
					two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest
					secrets reasonable.
				</t>
				<t>
					It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate
					these secrets be of sufficiently high quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number
					sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other
					weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be
					careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.
				</t>

			<section title="Signature Base String Limitations">
        <t>
          The signature base string has been designed to support the signature methods defined in
          this specification. When designing additional signature methods, the signature base
          string should be evaluated to ensure compatibility with the algorithms used.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request, such as most
          request entity-body, most entity-headers, and the order in which parameters are sent,
          servers should employ additional mechanisms to protect such elements.
