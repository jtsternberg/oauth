        [[ This draft is submitted for the consideration of the OAuth Working Group to be adoped as
        an official working group item per its current charter. Please discuss this draft on the
        <eref target="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth">oauth@ietf.org</eref> mailing
        list. ]]

      <t>
        With the growing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, clients need to allow
        other parties access to the resources they control. When granting access, clients should
        not be required to share their credentials (typically a username and passowrd), and should
        have the ability to restrict access to a limited subset of the resources they control or
        the access methods supported by these resources. These goals require new classes of
        authentication credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        The HTTP Basic and Digest Access authentication schemes defined by <xref target="RFC2617" />,
        enable clients to make authenticated HTTP requests by using a username (or userid) and
        a password. In most cases, the client uses a single set of credentials to access all the
        resources it controls which are hosted by the server.
      </t>
      <t>
        While the Basic and Digest schemes can be used to send credentials other than a username
        and password, their wide deployment and well-established behavior in user-agents preclude
        them from being used with other classes of credentials. Extending these schemes to support
        new classes would require impractical changes to their existing deployment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Token Access Authentication scheme provides a method for making authenticated HTTP
        requests using a token - an identifier used to denote an access grant with specific scope,
        duration, cryptographic properties, and other attributes. Tokens can issued by the server,
        self-issued by the client, or issued by a third party.
      </t>
      <t>
        The token scheme support an extensible set of credential classes, by enabling the server to
        declare the classes it supports. Token classes determine how tokens are obtained and the
        context in which they can be used. It also supports an extensible set of authentication
        methods and authentication coverage (the elements of the HTTP request such as the request
        URI or entity-body included in the authentication process).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines four token authentication methods to support the most common use
        cases and describes their security properties. The methods through which clients obtain
        tokens supporting these methods are beyond the scope of this specification. The OAuth
        protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-web-delegation" /> defines one such set of methods
        for obtaining <spanx style="oauth">oauth</spanx>-class token credentials.

        The clients makes authenticated requests by calculating the values of a set of attributes
        and adding them to the HTTP request using the <xref target="authz">Authorization header field</xref>.
        Authenticated request can be sent either directly (without first receiving a challenge), or
        in response to an authentication challenge.
      </t>
      <t>
        To make an authenticated request, the client obtains information about the token classes,
        authentication methods, and authentication coverage supported by the server. This
        information is provided by the server via the <xref target="authn">WWW-Authenticate header field</xref>.
        The client SHOULD only send an authenticated request to server (without first receiving a
        challenge) when it has prior knowledge of the token classes, methods, and other attributes
        supported by server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client chooses an available token with the supported class and authentication method,
        as well as a supported authentication coverage. The methods through which the client
        obtains a valid token, or the criteria used to choose a token if more than one is available
        are beyond the scope of this specificaiton.

            If using the <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> or
            <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> signature methods, ensure that the combination
            of nonce/timestamp/token (if present) received from the client has not been used
            before in a previous request (the server MAY reject requests with stale timestamps).

          <t>
            If a token is present, verify the scope and status of the client authorization as

      <t>
        The server SHOULD return a 400 (bad request) status code
        when receiving a request with unsupported parameters, unsupported signature method,
        missing parameters, or duplicated protocol parameters. The server SHOULD return a 401
        (unauthorized) status code when receiving a request with invalid client credentials,

    <section title="Authentication Methods" anchor="methods">
      <t>
				In order for the server to verify the authenticity of the request and prevent unauthorized
        access, the client needs to prove that it is the rightful owner of the credentials. This is
        accomplished using the shared-secret and authentication method associated with the token.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides three methods for the client to prove its rightful ownership of the
        credentials: <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>,
        and <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx>. These methods are generally referred to as
        signature methods, even though <spanx style="verb">PLAINTEXT</spanx> does not involve a
        signature. In addition, <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx> utilizes an RSA key instead
        of the shared-secrets associated with the client credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client declares which signature method is used via the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature_method</spanx> parameter. It then generates a signature
        (or a string of an equivalent value), and includes it in the
        <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter. The server verifies the signature
        as specified for each method.
      </t>
      <t>
        The signature process does not change the request or its parameters, with the exception of
        the <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx> parameter.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'none' Method">
        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> method does not employ a cryptographic algorithm
          and does not provide any security on its own. Servers utilizing this method use the token
          identifier as a bearer token, relying solely on the value of the token identifier to
          authenticate the client.
        </t>
        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">coverage</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>,
          <spanx style="verb">timestamp</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">auth</spanx> attributes
          are not used, and SHOULD NOT be included in authenticated requests.

    <section title="Signature Base String">
      <t>
        The signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several
        of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to
        the <spanx style="verb">HMAC-SHA1</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">RSA-SHA1</spanx>
        signature methods.
      </t>
      <t>
        The signature base string includes the following components of the HTTP request:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The HTTP request method (e.g. <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>,
            <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>, etc.).
          </t>
          <t>
            The authority as declared by the HTTP <spanx style="verb">Host</spanx> request
            header.
          </t>
          <t>
            The path and query components of the request resource URI.
          </t>
          <t>
            The protocol parameters excluding the
            <spanx style="verb">oauth_signature</spanx>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Parameters included in the request entity-body if they comply with the strict
            restrictions defined in <xref target="collect_param" />.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it
        does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP
        entity-headers. It is important to note that the server cannot verify the authenticity
        of the excluded request components without using additional protections such as SSL/TLS or
        other methods.
      </t>

      <section title="String Construction" anchor="base_string">
        <t>
          The signature base string is constructed by concatenating together, in order, the
          following HTTP request elements:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              The HTTP request method in uppercase. For example: <spanx style="verb">HEAD</spanx>,
              <spanx style="verb">GET</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>, etc. If the
              request uses a custom HTTP method, it MUST be <xref target="encoding">encoded</xref>.
            </t>

      <section title="Percent Encoding" anchor="encoding">
        <t>
          Existing percent-encoding methods do not guarantee a consistent construction of the
          signature base string. The following percent-encoding method is not defined to replace
          the existing encoding methods defined by <xref target="RFC3986" /> and
          <xref target="W3C.REC-html40-19980424" />. It is used only in the construction of the
          signature base string.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification defines the following method for percent-encoding strings:

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Text values are first encoded as UTF-8 octets per <xref target="RFC3629" /> if they are
              not already. This does not include binary values which are not intended for human
              consumption.
            </t>
            <t>
              The values are then escaped using the <xref target="RFC3986" /> percent-encoding
              (%XX) mechanism as follows:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  Characters in the unreserved character set as defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />
                  section 2.3 (ALPHA, DIGIT, "-", ".", "_", "~") MUST NOT be encoded.
                </t>
                <t>
                  All other characters MUST be encoded.
                </t>
                <t>
                  The two hexadecimal characters used to represent encoded characters MUST be
                  upper case.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          This method is different from the encoding scheme used by the
          <spanx style="verb">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</spanx> content-type (for example,
          it encodes space characters as <spanx style="verb">%20</spanx> and not using the
          <spanx style="verb">+</spanx> character). It MAY be different from the
          percent-encoding functions provided by web development frameworks (e.g. encode different
          characters, use lower case hexadecimal characters).

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        As stated in <xref target="RFC2617" />, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not
        in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use. Implementers
        are strongly encouraged to assess how this protocol addresses their security requirements.
      </t>

      <section title="Credentials Transmission">
        <t>
          This specification does not describe any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting tokens.
          Methods used to obtain tokens should ensure that these transmissions are protected using
          transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plain Method" anchor="plain_ssl">
        <t>
          When used with the <spanx style="verb">Plain</spanx> method, the protocol makes no
          attempt to protect credentials from eavesdroppers or man-in-the-middle attacks. The
          <spanx style="verb">Plain</spanx> method is only intended to be used in conjunction
          with a transport-layer security mechanism such as TLS or SSL which does provide such
          protection, or in combination with other security mechanisms.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Confidentiality of Requests">
        <t>
          While this protocol provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests, it
          provides no guarantee of request confidentiality. Unless further precautions are taken,
          eavesdroppers will have full access to request content. Servers should carefully consider
          the kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and should employ
          transport-layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers">
        <t>
          This protocol makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the server. A hostile party
          could take advantage of this by intercepting the client's requests and returning
          misleading or otherwise incorrect responses. Service providers should consider such
          attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should require transport-layer
          security for any requests where the authenticity of the server or of request responses is
          an issue.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Plaintext Storage of Credentials">
        <t>
          The token shared-secret function the same way passwords do in traditional authentication
          systems. In order to compute the signatures used in methods, the server must have access
          to these secrets in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating
          systems, which store only a one-way hash of user credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse, to the server's database
          of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any
          resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these secrets from
          unauthorized access.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scoping of Access Requests">
        <t>
          By itself, this protocol does not provide any method for scoping the access rights
          granted to a client. However, most applications do require greater granularity of access
          rights. For example, servers may wish to make it possible to grant access to some
          protected resources but not others, or to grant only limited access (such as read-only
          access) to those protected resources.
        </t>
        <t>
          When implementing this protocol, servers should consider the types of access resource
          owners may wish to grant clients, and should provide mechanisms to do so. Servers should
          also take care to ensure that resource owners understand the access they are granting, as
          well as any risks that may be involved.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Entropy of Secrets">
        <t>
          Unless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access
          to authenticated requests and signatures, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force
          attacks to recover the credentials used. Servers should be careful to assign
          shared-secrets which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at
          least the length of time that the shared-secrets are valid.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if shared-secrets are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is
          not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the shared-secret in less than
          two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the longest
          secrets reasonable.

          It is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate
          these secrets be of sufficiently high quality. Many PRNG implementations generate number
          sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other
          weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be
          careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.

      <section title="Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks">
        <t>
          This specification includes a number of features which may make resource exhaustion
          attacks against servers possible. For example, this protocol requires servers to track
          used nonces. If an attacker is able to use many nonces quickly, the resources required to
          track them may exhaust available capacity. And again, this protocol can require servers
          to perform potentially expensive computations in order to verify the signature on
          incoming requests. An attacker may exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by
          sending a large number of invalid requests to the server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to this specification. However,
          implementers should be careful to consider the additional avenues of attack that this
          protocol exposes, and design their implementations accordingly. For example, entropy
          starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service while the system
          waits for new entropy or else in weak (easily guessable) secrets. When implementing this
          protocol, servers should consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their
          application and design accordingly.
        </t>

      <section title="Signature Base String Limitations">
        <t>
          The signature base string has been designed to support the signature methods defined in
          this specification. Those designing additional signature methods, should evaluated the
          compatibility of the signature base string with their security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since the signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request, such as most
          request entity-body, most entity-headers, and the order in which parameters are sent,
          servers should employ additional mechanisms to protect such elements.
